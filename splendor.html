	<h2> Splendor AI </h2>
	<p> Splendor is an excellent 4 player board game that I particularly enjoy because of how accessible and fun it is for first timers, while still rewarding strategy and deep game knowledge. Everyone feels like they have a decent chance of winning, and the games are often decided by one or two quick turns. Out of all the games I have introduced to people, Splendor has the highest rate of people subsquently buying the game for themselves. The only downside is that it only plays 4 people, and the expansions change the win condition not the player count. This project aims to make a generic Splendor AI to test different rulesets of 5 (or 6) player Splendor with the goal of achieving a win-rate that is not turn order dependent.
